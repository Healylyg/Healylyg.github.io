			                <p> I am currently a second-year Capstone Master's student in Biostatistics at University of Washington and will graduate in March, 2024. I have experience with data analysis and visualization from the internship in Suzhou Abogen Biosciences and currently working on the capstone project about piloting machine learning model on mild cognitive function onset prediction. I am also learning more programming languages including SAS , Python and hope to apply those skills in my future career </p>
