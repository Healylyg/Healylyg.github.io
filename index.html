			                <p> I am a master’s student in biostatistics at University of Washington, and my bachelor’s degree in statistics is completed in Ohio State University. I individually completed multiple self-interested projects including investigating the effect of Covid-19 on movie’s box office and predict incident of lung cancer by using statistical models. My past experiences also include participating in student organizations where I corporate with other members in holding school events and help the advertising process. </p>
					
					<p> I am interested in Biostatistics and more specifically, in statistical genes, which is the track I plan to choose in the second year of the program. I also enjoy the process of investigating the complex association among different variables in data using the programmatic data analysis skills. </p>
